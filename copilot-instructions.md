When programming in Angular keep these instructions in mind:
When you update a component, be sure to put the logic in the ts file, the styles in the css file and the html template in the html file.

## Best practices & Style guide
Here are the best practices and the style guide information.

### Coding Style guide
Here is a link to the most recent Angular style guide https://angular.dev/style-guide

### TypeScript Best Practices
- Use strict type checking
- Prefer type inference when the type is obvious
- Avoid the `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain

### Angular Best Practices
- Always use standalone components over `NgModules`
- Don't use explicit `standalone: true` (it is implied by default)
- Use signals for state management
- Implement lazy loading for feature routes
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for all static images.

### Components
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use `input()` signal instead of decorators, learn more here https://angular.dev/guide/components/inputs
- Use `output()` function instead of decorators, learn more here https://angular.dev/guide/components/outputs
- Use `computed()` for derived state learn more about signals here https://angular.dev/guide/signals.
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in `@Component` decorator
- Prefer inline templates for small components
- Prefer Reactive forms instead of Template-driven ones
- Do NOT use `ngClass`, use `class` bindings instead, for context: https://angular.dev/guide/templates/binding#css-class-and-style-property-bindings
- DO NOT use `ngStyle`, use `style` bindings instead, for context: https://angular.dev/guide/templates/binding#css-class-and-style-property-bindings

### State Management
- Use signals for local component state
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Keep state transformations pure and predictable

### Templates
- Keep templates simple and avoid complex logic
- Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`
- Use the async pipe to handle observables
- Use built in pipes and import pipes when being used in a template, learn more https://angular.dev/guide/templates/pipes#

### Services
- Design services around a single responsibility
- Use the `providedIn: 'root'` option for singleton services
- Use the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection
